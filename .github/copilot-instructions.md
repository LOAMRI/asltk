# ASL toolkit Copilot Instructions

- Focus on the `asltk` Python library for Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI processing.
- Prefer code and APIs from the workspace (e.g., `asltk.asldata`, `asltk.reconstruction`, `asltk.utils`).
- Use concise, clear bullet points and code examples.
- Reference workspace files and symbols with links when possible.
- Follow the project's coding style and documentation patterns (Google-style docstrings).
- Suggest improvements or fixes based on the workspace context.
- Avoid general Python advice unless relevant to the workspace.
- Respect the project's contribution guidelines and code of conduct.
- Highlight available scripts in `asltk/scripts` for common workflows.
- Use supported image formats: `.nii`, `.nii.gz`, `.mha`, `.nrrd`.
- Ensure that the code is syntactically correct and adheres to the project's coding standards.
- Be sure about the documentation and comments. They should be clear and concise and use the correct Python docstring format.
- Create commit messages with a detailed description of the changes made, including any bug fixes or new features.
- Be as much specific as possible in the commit messages, including the files affected and the nature of the changes.
- Uses for commit messages prefixes the following pattern:
  - `ENH:` for new features and code enhancements
  - `BUG:` for bug fixes and general corrections
  - `DOC:` for documentation changes
  - `STY:` for formatting changes (not affecting code logic)
  - `TEST:` for adding or modifying tests
