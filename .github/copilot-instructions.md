# ASL toolkit Copilot Instructions

- Focus on the `asltk` Python library for Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI processing.
- Prefer code and APIs from the workspace (e.g., `asltk.asldata`, `asltk.reconstruction`, `asltk.utils`).
- Use concise, clear bullet points and code examples.
- Reference workspace files and symbols with links when possible.
- Follow the project's coding style and documentation patterns (Google-style docstrings).
- Suggest improvements or fixes based on the workspace context.
- Avoid general Python advice unless relevant to the workspace.
- Respect the project's contribution guidelines and code of conduct.
- Highlight available scripts in `asltk/scripts` for common workflows.
- Use supported image formats: `.nii`, `.nii.gz`, `.mha`, `.nrrd`.
