# Getting started

This section will help you quickly start using the `asltk` library by providing simple examples and code snippets for different scenarios.

## Simple Example of How to Use the Library

Letâ€™s begin with a basic example that demonstrates how to import `asltk` and use its core functionality. We will start considering the basic creating of the `ASLData` object, which is the basic structure to store and manage the ASL data to use in the code:

```python
from asltk.asldata import ASLData

data = ASLData(
    pcasl='path/to/pcasl.nii.gz',
    m0='path/to/m0.nii.gz',
    ld_values=[100.0, 150.0, 250.0],
    pld_values=[100.0, 120.0, 150.0],
    te_values=[12.5, 36.7, 85.5]
)
```

The example above creates an `asldata.ASLData` object, called `data`, which will store the pCASL and M0 images, along with the LD, PLD and TE values (in this case we are showing a prototype of multiTE-ASL data loading)

!!! tip
    There are many other image file formatts that is accepted in the `asltk` tool. We adopted the `SimpleITK` API, then one can check the image formatts in the [official documentation](https://simpleitk.readthedocs.io/en/master/IO.html)

## Example operation using `asltk`

The following examples can represents some situations on ASL data processing:

1. Load a pCASL and M0 data and reconstruct a basic CBF/ATT mapping

```python
from asltk.asldata import ASLData
from asltk.reconstruction import CBFMapping

data = ASLData(
    pcasl='./tests/files/pcasl_mte.nii.gz',
    m0='path/to/m0.nii.gz',
    ld_values=[100.0, 150.0, 250.0],
    pld_values=[100.0, 120.0, 150.0],
    te_values=[12.5, 36.7, 85.5])

cbf = CBFMapping(data) # insert the ASLData in the CBFMapping instance
out = cbf.create_map() # Effectivelly creates the CBF/ATT maps

out.get('cbf') # Get the CBF map image
out.get('att') # Get the ATT map image
```

!!! info
    This example uses a multiTE-ASL data to reconstruct the CBF/ATT maps. However, this is only a simple representation. The same output can be found using a simple pCASL aquisition without the TE values being acquired. In this case, the `te_values` passed to the `ASLDATA` constructor is not necessary.

2.  Load a pCASL and M0 data for multiTE-ASL processing obtaingin the T1 exchange from blood to Grey Matter mapping

```python
from asltk.asldata import ASLData
from asltk.reconstruction import CBFMapping

data = ASLData(
    pcasl='./tests/files/pcasl_mte.nii.gz',
    m0='path/to/m0.nii.gz',
    ld_values=[100.0, 150.0, 250.0],
    pld_values=[100.0, 120.0, 150.0],
    te_values=[12.5, 36.7, 85.5])

cbf = CBFMapping(data) # insert the ASLData in the CBFMapping instance
out = cbf.create_map() # Effectivelly creates the CBF/ATT maps

out.get('cbf') # Get the CBF map image
out.get('att') # Get the ATT map image
```

!!! note
    By default, all the `reconstruction` classes uses a multiprocessing strategy for CPU threads. This will accelerate the mapping creation. As a internal standard, all the available CPU cores in the machine is recruited. If there is a limitation to your machine/experiment that is not allowed such quantity of CPUs, then a lower value can be set using the `cores` parameter in the `create_map` method.

## Load and process an image

As as standard notation, the `asltk` library assumes that all the image data files are storaged and manipulated using `numpy` objects. Therefore, the following code snippets can represents the `load_image` and `save_image` pattern adopted in the tool:

1. Loading and saving an image

```python
from asltk.utils import load_image, save_image

img = load_image('path/to/pcasl.nii.gz') #Loading an image
type(img)
< numpy.ndarray >

save_image(img, 'path/to/save/the/image.nrrd') # Saving the image using NRRD file format

```

!!! warning
    The `asltk` uses the `SimpleITK` library to load and save images due to it's long list of image format options, e.g. NifTI, NRRD, MHA, etc. However, in order to transpose to `numpy.array` data format for image processing, it is important to note that the image space rasteting format relies as follows:
    ```
    SimpleITK -> (x,y,z,...,n_d)
    Numpy -> (n_d, ..., z,y,x)
    ```
    Where the `n_d` represents a higher order dimension in the data.

Basically, one can use out tool for the general pipeline:

* Loading a data and metadata, 
* Choosing the right ASL processing algorithm for the data loaded
* Saving the outcomes generated in the `asltk` tool.

## Using the library scripts

Another quick and easy way to learn how to use the ASL processing algorithms implemented in the `asltk` library is using our Python scripts.

All the scripts are located in the `asltk/scripts` folder, which is basically a simple way to run a determined kind of ASL processing.

At the moment, there are the following scripts avaliable:

1. `cbf.py`: Python script focused on calculating CBF/ATT maps using pCASL images. This script is based on the `CBFMapping` class.
2. `te_asl.py`: Python script focused on calculating T1 relaxation exchange time between Blood and Grey-Matter (T1blGM) map using pCASL multi-TE ASL images. This script is based on the `MultiTE_ASLMapping` class.

Here's an example of how to call the cbf.py script to calculate CBF/ATT maps using pCASL images:

```bash
python -m asltk.scripts.cbf --pcasl ./path/to/pcasl_image.nii.gz --m0 ./path/to/m0_image.nii.gz --output ./path/to/output_directory
```

In this example:

- `--pcasl` specifies the path to the pCASL image.
- `--m0` specifies the path to the M0 image.
- `--output` specifies the directory where the output CBF/ATT maps will be saved.

!!! tip
    Make sure to replace `./path/to/pcasl_image.nii.gz`, `./path/to/m0_image.nii.gz`, and `./path/to/output_directory` with the actual paths to your pCASL image, M0 image, and desired output directory, respectively.

Anyway, the complete description on how to call a `asltk` script can be checked using the `--help` command:

```bash
python -m asltk.scripts.cbf --help

usage: CBF/ATT Mapping [-h] --pld PLD [PLD ...] --ld LD [LD ...] [--verbose] pcasl m0 [mask] [out_folder]

Python script to calculate the basic CBF and ATT maps from ASL data.

Required parameters:
  pcasl                ASL raw data obtained from the MRI scanner. This must be the basic PLD ASL MRI acquisition
                       protocol.
  m0                   M0 image reference used to calculate the ASL signal.
  out_folder           The output folder that is the reference to save all the output images in the script. The
                       images selected to be saved are given as tags in the script caller, e.g. the options --cbf_map
                       and --att_map. By default, the TblGM map is placed in the output folder with the name
                       tblgm_map.nii.gz
  --pld PLD [PLD ...]  Posts Labeling Delay (PLD) trend, arranged in a sequence of float numbers
  --ld LD [LD ...]     Labeling Duration trend (LD), arranged in a sequence of float numbers.

Optional parameters:
  mask                 Image mask defining the ROI where the calculations must be done. Any pixel value different
                       from zero will be assumed as the ROI area. Outside the mask (value=0) will be ignored. If not
                       provided, the entire image space will be calculated.
  --verbose            Show more details thoughout the processing.
```

Additional scripts can be added in the `asltk` library, by the community contribution. If it is your interest, then go to the [developing scripts](contribute.md) section at the developer guidelines.
