# Reports Module

## Brain Parcellation

The Parcellation Report module provides utilities for generating detailed reports on brain parcellation results. These reports help users summarize, visualize, and interpret the outcomes of brain region segmentation and labeling processes. The module supports integration with the Brain Atlas workflow, enabling streamlined analysis and documentation of parcellation data.

Use this module to create standardized, reproducible reports that facilitate communication and comparison of parcellation results across studies.

!!! note
    The `reports` module provides quantitative pipelines designed to deliver clear and concise views of scientific data. Refer to the documentation for each available report to determine which method best suits your application.
