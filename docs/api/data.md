# Data Module 

## Brain Atlas

The `Brain Atlas` module provides tools and data structures for representing, manipulating, and analyzing brain region information. It serves as a foundational component for working with anatomical brain atlases, enabling users to access region metadata, and collect atlas data into neuroimaging workflows.

Use this module to facilitate research and development tasks that require standardized brain region definitions and mappings. 

!!! tip
    The full list of availble brain atlases and templates in the `alstk` can be fetch using the `list_all()` method, as seen in the API description below

!!! note
    This module is intended for use with standardized brain atlases and may require adaptation for custom or non-standard datasets. Refer to the official documentation for integration guidelines and best practices.
