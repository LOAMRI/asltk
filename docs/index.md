# ASLtk - Arterial Spin Labeling toolkit

![project logo](assets/asltk-logo.png){ width="350" .center}
Welcome to the ASL toolkit!

This library was designed to assist users in processing Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI images, from basic imaging protocols to the state-of-the-art models provided in the scientific literature.

The major objective of this project is to give an open-source alternative to researchers in the MRI field. A profound knowledge of computing and data modelling is not a prior demand. It is expected that a simple set of Python commands can be helpful in fast prototyping an ASL experiment or even collecting simple quantitative ASL-based information.

The full documentation of the usage, implementation and updates in the `asltk` library is given in this repository and posted online using a web-based host. In this documentation it is expected to find the basic usage of the `asltk` tool and also the major points to consider whether one may contribute directly to the project.

The general organization of this document is as follows:

!!! note
    All the documentation is by default generated in the American English language. Even though this may not be the first language for some users or code developers (including me), it is encouraging to follow this language format to keep the information as broad and accessible as possible. Furthermore, better documentation is also a wonderful way to help the project, so if you want to contribute to correcting typos, grammar or confounding sentences, please make a PR!


## Audience 

Even though any person can install and use the `asltk` library, it is expected that the following people can be more affected by this project:

* Academic researchers in the ASL-MRI field
* Students in their Masters, PhD or specializations regarding ASL projects
* Computer scientists or computing enthusiasts on the image-processing field

## Licence

The `asltk` library is distributed under the MIT License, a permissive open-source license that allows users to freely use, modify, distribute, and even incorporate the library into commercial projects. With the MIT License, you are free to do almost anything with the code as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any significant portions of the software.
